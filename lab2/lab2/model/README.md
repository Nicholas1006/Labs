# Tree model 

The tree model is an AI generated 3D model. The steps to create this model is as follows. 

1) Generate an image using the following prompt:
"Generate an image of a autumn tree in 3D, white background, low poly". 

You can use any text-to-image generation model but we used NVIDIA's Sana: https://nvlabs.github.io/Sana/

2) Pass the image to Microsoft TRELLIS to predict a 3D model from a single image.

Extract GLB model. 

3) Convert GLB to GLTF model. We used the service from https://convert3d.org/ 
In fact this conversion step is not necessary if the code supports the GLB format directly. 


# Bus model 

The bus model is generated by the TRELLIS authors and available at https://microsoft.github.io/TRELLIS/assets/txt2/glbs/bus.glb
